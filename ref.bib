In particular, we show that penalized wavelets are analogous to penalized splines; the latter being the established approach to function estimation in semiparametric regression. They diﬀer only in the type of penalization that is appropriate. This fact is not borne out by the existing wavelet literature, where the regression modelling and ﬁtting issues are overshadowed by computational issues such as eﬃciency gains aﬀorded by the Discrete Wavelet Transform and partially obscured by a tendency to work in the wavelet coeﬃcient space. With penalized wavelet structure in place, we then show that ﬁtting and inference can be achieved via the same general approaches used for penalized splines: penalized least squares, maximum likelihood and best prediction within a frequentist mixed model framework, and Markov chain Monte Carlo and mean ﬁeld variational Bayes within a Bayesian framework. Penalized wavelets are also shown have a close relationship with wide data (“p ≫ n”) regression and beneﬁt from ongoing research on that topic.},

The link considered has a semiparametric expression: if we are interested in a functional inﬂuence of some covariates, we authorize others to be modeled linearly. We thus consider a generalized partially linear regression model with unknown regression coefﬁcients and an unknown nonparametric function. We present a maximum penalized likelihood procedure to estimate the components of the model introducing penalty based wavelet estimators. Asymptotic rates of the estimates of both the parametric and the nonparametric part of the model are given and quasi-minimax optimality is obtained under usual conditions in literature. We establish in particular that the 1-penalty leads to an adaptive estimation with respect to the regularity of the estimated function. An algorithm based on backﬁtting and Fisher-scoring is also proposed for implementation. Simulations are used to illustrate the ﬁnite sample behavior, including a comparison with kernel- and spline-based methods.},

A multiresolution analysis of a point process is formulated which motivates the deﬁnition of homogeneity at diﬀerent scales of resolution, termed J-th level homogeneity. Further to this, the activity in a point processes’ ﬁrst order behavior at diﬀerent scales of resolution is also deﬁned and termed L-th level innovation. Likelihood ratio tests for both these properties are proposed with asymptotic distributions provided, even when only a single realization of the point process is observed. The test for L-th level innovation forms the basis for a collection of statistical strategies for thresholding coeﬃcients in a wavelet based estimator of the intensity function. These thresholding strategies are shown to outperform the existing local hard thresholding strategy on a range of simulation scenarios.},

Our model combines the techniques in information geometry to model higher-order interactions on a statistical manifold and in generalized additive models to use lower-dimensional projections to overcome the effects from the curse of dimensionality. Our approach solves a convex optimization problem by minimizing the KL divergence from a sample distribution in lower dimensional projections to the distribution modeled by an intensity function in the stochastic process. Our empirical results show that our model is able to use samples observed in the lower dimensional space to estimate the higher-order intensity function with extremely sparse observations.},

Goodness-of-ﬁt tests are also proposed and are proved to be of prescribed asymptotical level. They enable us to test these non-parametric models. Various simulations show good performance of the estimation and test procedures. A complete analysis is also performed with these tools on single unit activity recorded on a monkey during a sensory-motor task. We can show that the homogeneous Poisson process hypothesis is always rejected and that the inhomogeneous Poisson process hypothesis is rarely accepted.

In this paper, we consider multivariate counting processes depending on an unknown function parameter to be estimated by linear combinations of a ﬁxed dictionary. To select coeﬃcients, we propose an adaptive 1-penalization methodology, where data-driven weights of the penalty are derived from new Bernstein type inequalities for martingales. Oracle inequalities are established under assumptions on the Gram matrix of the dictionary. Non-asymptotic probabilistic results for multivariate Hawkes processes are proven, which allows us to check these assumptions by considering general dictionaries based on histograms, Fourier or wavelet bases. Motivated by problems of neuronal activity inference, we ﬁnally carry out a simulation study for multivariate Hawkes processes and compare our methodology with the adaptive Lasso procedure proposed by Zou in [64]. We observe an excellent behavior of our procedure. We rely on theoretical aspects for the essential question of tuning our methodology. Unlike adaptive Lasso of [64], our tuning procedure is proven to be robust with respect to all the parameters of the problem, revealing its potential for concrete purposes, in particular in neuroscience.},

Some of the previously used methods are in the general statistical framework of the multivariate Hawkes processes. However, they usually require a huge amount of data, some prior knowledge about the recorded network, and/or may produce an increasing number of spikes along time during simulation. New Method: Here, we present a method, based on least-square estimators and LASSO penalty criteria, for a particular class of Hawkes processes that can be used for simulation.
Results: Testing our method on small networks modeled with Leaky Integrate and Fire demonstrated that it eﬃciently detects both excitatory and inhibitory connections. The few errors that occasionally occur with complex networks including common inputs, weak and chained connections, can be discarded based on objective criteria.
Comparison with existing methods: With respect to other existing methods, the present one allows to reconstruct functional connectivity of small networks without prior knowledge of their properties or architecture, using an experimentally realistic amount of data.
Conclusions: The present method is robust, stable, and can be used on a personal computer as a routine procedure to infer connectivity graphs and generate simulation models from simultaneous spike train recordings.},

In contrast, nonlinear estimates are generally more accurate. In this paper, we focus on nonparametric penalized likelihood regression methods using splines and a variety of nonquadratic penalties, pointing out common basic principles. We present an asymptotic analysis of convergence rates that justiﬁes the approach. We report on a simulation study including comparisons between our method and some existing ones.

Emerging smart grid technologies pose new challenges and opportunities. Although load forecasting at the aggregate level has been extensively studied, electrical load forecasting at fine-grained geographical scales of households is more challenging. Among existing approaches, semi-parametric generalized additive models (GAM) have been increasingly popular due to their accuracy, flexibility, and interpretability. Their applicability is justified when forecasting is addressed at higher levels of aggregation, since the aggregated load pattern contains relatively smooth additive components. High resolution data are highly volatile, forecasting the average load using GAM models with smooth components does not provide meaningful information about the future demand. Instead, we need to incorporate irregular and volatile effects to enhance the forecast accuracy. We focus on the analysis of such hybrid additive models applied on smart meters data and show that it leads to improvement of the forecasting performances of classical additive models at low aggregation levels.},

To achieve optimal rates in large sample situations we use hybrid P-splines and block wavelet penalisation techniques combined with adaptive (group) LASSO-like procedures for selecting the additive components in the nonparametric part of the models. Hence, the component selection and estimation in the nonparametric part may be viewed as a functional version of estimation and grouped variable selection. This allows to take advantage of several oracle results which yield asymptotic optimality of estimators in high-dimensional but sparse additive models. Numerical implementations of our procedures for proximal like algorithms are discussed. Large sample properties of the estimates and of the model selection are presented and the results are illustrated with simulated examples and a real data analysis.},
